          <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Self-Motivated problem solver and creator of cool things.</p>

            <p>I am a self starter when it comes to all of my passions and I apply my passions in everything I do. Working at early stage startups for the past 7 years forces me to wear a plethora of hats, which constantly keeps me on my toes. Building dynamic teams and empowering people to reach their potential drive my leadership style.</p>

            <p>With over a decade of experience in software engineering, I have a deep working knowledge into the product lifecycle and building new systems from the ground up. I enjoy nothing more than working with a team to take an idea to MVP and then to a production quality solution. The puzzles solved through this process continuously empower me to grow my skillset. To me nothing is more exciting than the first few commits into a new codebase because I love diving into a new project head first.</p>

            <p>Check out my projects section below to see some of my open source projects. Most are playgrounds made to learn new technologies or just goof around with code.</p>
