Working at early stage startups for the past 7 years forces me to wear a plethora of hats, which constantly keeps me on my toes. Building dynamic teams and empowering people to reach their potential drive my leadership style.</p>-->

            <p>With over a decade of experience in software engineering, I have a deep working knowledge into the product lifecycle and building new systems from the ground up. I enjoy nothing more than working with a team to take an idea to MVP and then to a production quality solution. The puzzles solved through this process continuously empower me to grow my skill-set. To me nothing is more exciting than my first few commits into a new code-base because I love diving into a new project head first.</p>

             During my time at Minim I found many passions and faced countless challenges.

             Along with this our largest Kubernetes region grew to handle more than 1 million requests per minute.
             Both of these challenged me in ways I haven't been before.
